## 1. Overview

This project is a simple digital clock application created using Python's `tkinter` library. It displays the current time and updates every second, with a background color that cycles through a predefined list of colors.

## 2. Features

- Real-time clock display
- Background color cycling every second
- Customizable font, size, and color of the time display

## 3. Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter (comes with standard Python installations)

## 4. Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   
## 5. Usage

1. **Run the Digital Clock Application:**

   ```bash
   python digital_clock.py

  **Ensure that you have tkinter installed and available in your Python environment.**

2. **Observe the Clock:**

The digital clock will be displayed in a window with a background color that changes every second.
The clock updates in real-time, showing hours, minutes, and seconds.

## 6. Customization:

Font and Size: Modify the font parameter in the tk.Label widget.
Color Scheme: Adjust the bg_colors list to include any colors you prefer.
